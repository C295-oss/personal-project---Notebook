## Description:
This is a basic text editor I made, as a personal project. It can write to files, save info to files, and has the ability to run code. It was made using Tkinter. The reason for the use of tkinter is because tkinter is a good choice for making GUIs in python. My program is also not that complex, so I felt that I didn't need to use Kivy. 

## Reasoning:
The reason for this project was because I wanted to become more familiar with the Tkinter library, as well as OOP, and work on file handling. I also thought it sounded fun to do, and wanted to try it out.

## Features:

<ul>
  <li>Open files: Can open txt, and python files</li>
  <li>Save & Save As: Can save to files, create new files, and overwrite existing info on files</li>
  <li>Python: Has the ability to open python files, and run the program in a terminal or command prompt</li>
  <li>Light or Dark Mode: The ability to switch between light mode and dark mode, and it remembers your choice</li>
</ul>


## How to install and run project: 
1: Download the project files. <br />
2: Open main.py -- This file just calls the gui, and runs it like any tkinter file. The actual gui is in gui.py. <br />
3: Run the program. <br />

### Alternate:
1: Download the project files. <br />
2: put usrChoice.py and gui.py in the folder of your choice. <br />
3: Import them into the files of your choice. <br />
4: You should be able to call the class, and run it. <br />
