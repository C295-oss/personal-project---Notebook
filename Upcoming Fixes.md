# Upcoming Changes

## Description: 
This is a personal project aimed at the following areas: OOP, filehandling, and tkinter. It is also a way for me to learn how to use Github. 
It is meant to be a simple GUI that allows for simple scripts, and the ability to write to a file.


## Features: 
The GUI allows the user to open files, save text written to those files on them, and run Python code as long as it is a python file. Currently, you cannot create a save file within the text editor; the file would need to already exist.

## Upcoming changes:
  - Ability to create a file with save.
  - Light and dark mode -- currently only has dark mode
  - Cleaning up code -- adding comments, and bug hunting
  - An Icon
